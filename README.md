# VirtualWorld APP

Simple virtual world simulator based on the turn-based system where a user can perform turns and watch how the environment is changing. There are two types of organisms:
plants and animals. Each kind of animal has it's own additional behaviour, each kind of plant provides another effect after being eaten. User can perform a turn,
reset the simulation, save and load the world.

Every turn each animal moves on the adjacent field. If there is an animal of the same kind - they reproduce and a new animal appears on the map. If there is an animal of 
different type - they fight. Stronger animal survives, weaker dies. If animal steps on the plant, it eats it and gains an some additional effect. Plants cannot move, but 
they have 8% to reproduce itself during a turn.
